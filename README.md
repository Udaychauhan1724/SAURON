IOT-based traffic management system (using ultrasonic sensors sr-04 and bluetooth module hc-05)
This project uses ultrasonic sensors as well as cameras (using YOLO algorithm) to tackle the limitations of currently used camera only architectures in smart traffic management. There are 3 main limitations of camera only solutions we aimed to tackle:
Weather dependancy and reduced accuracy during night-time
Challenges in identifying vehicles in dense traffic
High installation costs
Our goal: to overcome them while ensuring seamless integration with existing systems.
Feel free to contact me for further information and personal experience with the project.
